        <h2 class="mb-3 text-decoration-underline">Why Sim Racing?</h2>
        <p>
            Sim racing (simulated racing) is more than a hobby—it’s a lifestyle.
            It’s where motorsport passion meets high-tech immersion.
            For some, it’s a serious training tool.
            For others, it’s the best way to say, "I drive a GT3 car… in my socks."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Whether you're chasing tenths in a Time Attack or just trying to not get punted into T1 (we’ve all been there), sim racing gives you the thrill of real racing—without needing to remortgage your house.
